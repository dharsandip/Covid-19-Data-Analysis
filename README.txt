This Data Science project is based on Covid-19 WHO Dataset, downloaded from Kaggle. Data is available for the period till 27th July, 2020 starting from 22nd January, 2020. Data is available for all the countries in the World. Goal is to visualize and analyze the data for selected countries, all the continents/regions and also for the entire world. In this study, pandas library in Python is used for various Dataframe operations (to make the data structured) and plotly (express, graph_objectsis etc.) is used for interactive visualizations (various interactive plots, Choropleth map etc.). We could extract various meaningful and interesting insight from the data visualizations and exploratory data analysis. 

Some of the important observations are given below:

-For countries like India, US, Brazil, Russia etc. number of confirmed covid-19 cases increased sharply from 1st April, 2020 till 27th July, 2020(till the date data was available).
-For European countries like Italy, Spain, France, UK etc. number of confirmed covid-19 cases started increasing sharply from March, 2020 onward. 
-For China, completely different trend is observed. It started increasing sharply in January and then reached almost a peak sometime in March, after that it remains almost flat (very little increase in confirmed covid-19 cases). 
-When we look at the WHO Regions, we see that the number of confirmed cases is highest in "Americas" and lowest in "Western Pacific" region. 
-If we look at the country-wise data, we see that US is having the highest number of confirmed cases (4.29 Millions) as on 27th July, followed by Brazil (2.44 M), followed by India (1.48 M).
-If we look at the country-wise data, we see that US is having the highest number of deaths as on 27th July, followed by Brazil, followed by UK.
-If we look at the country-wise data, we see that Brazil is having the highest number of recovered cases as on 27th July, followed by US, followed by India.
-If we look at the death rate(%) of various countries we see that UK is having the highest death rate(%) as on 27th July, followed by Italy, followed by France.
-If we look at the recovery rate(%) of various countries we see that China is having the highest recovery rate(%) as on 27th July, followed by Italy, followed by Brazil.
-When we look at the entire world, we see that the total number of confirmed cases as on 27th July is 16.48 Millions, number of recovered cases is 9.46 M and number of deaths is 648.6k. So, the death rate for the world is 3.93%. Recovery rate for the world is 57.4%.
-Choropleth map shows that except very few countries, number of confirmed cases is generally very less in the continent of Africa. One of the main reasons is very less travel to and from the African countries due to which Covid-19 did not spread much.
-For Canada, Australia, New zealand and some South-East Asian Countries, number of confirmed cases is also quite less surprisingly.
